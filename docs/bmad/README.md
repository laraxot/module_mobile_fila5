# Mobile BMAD dossier
**Purpose / product brief:** provide an agnostic NativePHP/mobile host; it consumes contracts and does not embed municipality or restaurant domain rules.
**Architecture:** mobile actions/adapters consume Fixcity/Geo/User contracts; canonical ticket semantics remain server/module-owned.
**PRD:** mobile discovery, location capture, report draft, upload retry, authentication and tracking parity.
**Epics:** host contract; mobile report slice; offline/error and release packaging.
**Discovered gaps:** establish supported platform matrix, offline draft policy, push token lifecycle, deep links and parity evidence.
**Release gate:** device smoke, denied permissions, offline recovery, secure storage and server-contract compatibility.
